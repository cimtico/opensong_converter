Convert opensong files to chord pro format.

Create a `tmp` directory within the cloned code and place your opensong files in that `tmp` directory, and run 
```
./convert_to_chartpro.rb
```

Alternatively, pass in the directory or file path that should be converted
```
./convert_to_chartpro.rb ./tmp
```
